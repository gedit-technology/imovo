Imovo :: possible tasks
=======================

- In `products/`, have an `imovo-product-build-everything.sh` script to build a
  whole (but single) product.

- In `products/`, create an `integration` product to build all libs and apps in
  the same prefix.

- Have an easier / less hacky / more generic way to launch installed programs.

- Test `imovo-utils-prepare-module-source-git-repo-cache.sh` when there are
  submodules. See the TODO comment in that file.
