Imovo - Install my own version of
=================================

Take the sources of some modules, compile them and install them in a custom
prefix.

Mini-[JHBuild](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Jhbuild) replacement. Imovo is
more procedural (and thus less declarative), although it contains a few
declarative files.

Implemented to better learn how all of this work (setting/adapting the required
environment variables, among other things), to have something more minimal that
I fully understand, and that suits my needs for the modules that I develop.
Also, having something custom can be beneficial, to quickly change some stuff,
to adapt for our own workflow, etc.
