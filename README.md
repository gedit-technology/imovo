Imovo - Install my own version of
=================================

Take the sources of some modules, compile them and install them in a custom
prefix.

Mini-[JHBuild](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Jhbuild) replacement. Imovo is
more procedural (and thus less declarative), although it contains a few
declarative files.

Initially implemented for learning purposes (setting/adapting the required
environment variables, among other things).

But I now prefer Imovo instead of JHBuild because it suits my needs for the
modules that I develop. Since it's me who implemented it, and also because it's
more minimal, I fully understand it. Also, having something custom can be
beneficial, to quickly change some stuff, to adapt to our own workflow, etc.
